# Bank Management System

## Introduction:

Hello! I'm Tirth Dhedhi, a first-year Information Technology student, and I'm thrilled to present my semester 2 assignmentâ€”a Bank Management System. This console-based application mirrors real-world banking operations, showcasing my grasp of fundamental programming concepts in C++.

The system covers account creation, balance checks, deposits, withdrawals, and hints at future features like transaction history. It embodies my understanding of data structures, functions, loops, and user input/output handling.

While the project meets basic requirements, there's room for improvement, like refining the handling of account names. As I progress in my studies, I'm eager to tackle more complex projects and enhance my contribution to the world of technology.

Thank you for exploring my work!

## Features:

1. **Account Management:**
   - Users can open a new account by providing their name, choosing an account number, and depositing an opening balance.

2. **Balance Inquiry:**
   - Users can check their account balance by entering their account number.

3. **Deposits:**
   - Account holders can make deposits by specifying the amount, which updates their account balance.

4. **Withdrawals:**
   - Withdrawal functionality is implemented with a check for sufficient balance. The account balance is updated accordingly.

5. **Transaction History (Placeholder):**
   - A placeholder function for viewing transaction history has been added, indicating a feature to be implemented in future updates.

6. **User Interface:**
   - The console-based user interface provides a simple and interactive menu for users to navigate through various banking operations.

## Usage:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hellaanxiouss/Bank-Management-System-V1.git
   ```

2. Compile the code:

   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o Bank-Management-System-V1
   ```

3. Run the executable:

   ```bash
   ./Bank-Management-System-V1
   ```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate through the Bank Management System.

## Future Improvements:

- Refine handling of account names, ensuring compatibility with names containing spaces.
- Implement the transaction history feature to provide users with a comprehensive account overview.
